    summary: `The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain is an 1876 novel about a young boy growing up 
    along the Mississippi River. The story is set in the fictional town of St. Petersburg, inspired by
    Hannibal, Missouri, where Twain lived. Tom Sawyer lives with his Aunt Polly and his half-brother Sid.
    Tom dirties his clothes in a fight and is made to whitewash the fence the next day as punishment.
    He cleverly persuades his friends to trade him small treasures for the privilege of doing his work.
    He then trades the treasures for Sunday School tickets which one normally receives for memorizing
    verses, redeeming them for a Bible, much to the surprise and bewilderment of the superintendent who
    thought "it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural
    wisdom on his premises—a dozen would strain his capacity, without a doubt." Tom falls in love with
    Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town, and persuades her to get "engaged" by kissing him. But their
    romance collapses when she learns Tom has been "engaged" previously to Amy Lawrence. Shortly after
    Becky shuns him, he accompanies Huckleberry Finn to the graveyard at night, where they witness
    the murder of Dr. Robinson.`,
